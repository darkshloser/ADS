# Algorithms & Data Structures (ADS)

This is a simple repository which can be used as a reference in regard of knowledge related to Algorithms or Data Structures.

The intention is also to contain simple implementations and descriptions for every single approach, which can be used as a template in some specific cases related to real life applications.

The intention is also to constantly add new theory and examples.

Here you can see the basic structure of this repository.
